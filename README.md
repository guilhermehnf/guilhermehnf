## <samp>Hello World!</samp> 🌍

<samp>
I'm a **technology student from Brazil 🇧🇷**, focused on learning and building projects with web development, automation, and game-related systems.
</samp>

<samp>
My journey in programming started at **11 years old**, when I took my first **Python course as a child**. Since then, I have been **self-taught**, constantly learning on my own, exploring new technologies, and improving through hands-on projects.
</samp>

I enjoy turning ideas into practical solutions, studying new technologies, and improving my skills step by step through active projects.
